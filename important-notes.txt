1. For all tests where the framework detected a bug in the application, I added annotations in the test titles.
These tests are not failing due to issues in the test framework â€” they fail because of actual bugs in the application.

2. Test results:
Single browser (e.g. Chrome): 28 out of 64 tests should pass
Single browser (e.g. Chrome): 36 out of 64 tests should fail
All browsers (Chrome + Firefox + Safari): 84 out of 192 tests should pass
All browsers (Chrome + Firefox + Safari): 108 out of 192 tests should fail

3. In some places, I added comments suggesting that certain things could be done differently, but I intentionally kept the current approach.

4. You can run the tests manually at any time using the "Run workflow" button in the GitHub Actions tab.
